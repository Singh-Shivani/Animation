# Text_Animation
It is just a simple animation of my name using SVG, CSS and JS. There is a great app for making SVGs and other realted stuff called as FIGMA.
All you have to do is to create a SVG file of text you want for animation, copy the code of SVG into your HTMl file, complete your CSS and JS file and you're done.
